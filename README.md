<b>A posture monitoring system</b>

Increasing screen time especially among younger generations and corporate sector workers will undoubtedly imply the deterioration of spinal health, eye health and chronically poor posture. This is corroborated by a wide array of relevant statistics. If an easily implementable solution is not enforced many people will suffer from the debilitating impact of poor posture. Our motive is to develop good posture habits by making people mindful about their postures when they are in front of the screen.
